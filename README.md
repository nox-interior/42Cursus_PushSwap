# Push_Swap

## Introduction
Push_Swap is a project from the 42 programming school that involves sorting a stack of integers with the least number of operations. The challenge is to implement a sorting algorithm that efficiently manages the stack using a set of allowed operations. The project tests your understanding of algorithm complexity, sorting algorithms, and data structures.

## Features
- Implements various sorting algorithms designed specifically for stack data structures.
- Provides a visual and/or textual output of the steps taken during the sorting process.
- Handles small to large sets of numbers with a focus on efficiency.

## Installation
To install and set up the Push_Swap project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/push_swap.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd push_swap
    ```
3. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    or, if you prefer to compile manually:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o push_swap *.c
    ```

## Usage
To run the Push_Swap program, use the following command:

```bash
./push_swap <list_of_integers>
```
For example:
```
./push_swap 3 2 5 1 4
```
